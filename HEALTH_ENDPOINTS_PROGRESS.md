# Health Endpoints Implementation Progress

## Goal
Implement `/health` and `/status` HTTP endpoints for the Claude Code Slack Bot to enable monitoring and health checks.

## Current Status
üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Started implementation

## Analysis
- The current application uses Slack Bolt framework with Socket Mode only
- No HTTP server is currently running on port 3000
- Need to add Express.js or similar HTTP server alongside Slack Bot
- Application structure: Single entry point in `src/index.ts` with Socket Mode Slack app

## Implementation Plan
1. ‚úÖ Analyze current codebase structure
2. üîÑ Create progress tracking file (this file)
3. ‚è≥ Add Express.js HTTP server dependency 
4. ‚è≥ Implement /health endpoint (basic health check)
5. ‚è≥ Implement /status endpoint (detailed status)
6. ‚è≥ Test endpoints
7. ‚è≥ Update recovery documentation
8. ‚è≥ Restart service and verify connectivity

## Technical Notes
- Current app uses @slack/bolt with Socket Mode (no HTTP receiver)
- Need to add Express server running parallel to Slack app
- Health endpoints should return JSON responses
- Status endpoint should include:
  - Slack connection status
  - Active sessions count  
  - Memory usage
  - Last successful interaction timestamp
  - MCP server status

## Issues Encountered
None yet.

## Last Updated
2025-08-12 - Started implementation

## Next Steps
Add Express.js dependency and implement HTTP server alongside Slack Socket Mode app.
